## PenguinScout

This project was created for TaxScouts.
The idea was to create a quick search interface using React and Redux and styled-components. I used the Penguin Random House book search API: [Link to Docs](http://www.penguinrandomhouse.biz/webservices/rest/)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
